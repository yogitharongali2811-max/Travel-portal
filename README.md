# TOURSIM-WEBSITE
This project is a simple tourism website designed to showcase various travel destinations. It combines HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing experience for users.

Overview

The website consists of multiple sections, each dedicated to a specific tourist destination. It uses Bootstrap components for stylish buttons and image carousels, while JavaScript enables smooth navigation between different sections.

Key Features

Page Structure:
The website layout is divided into several sections (section-1, section-2, etc.), each enclosed within <div> tags and given unique IDs for easy navigation and manipulation.

Content Organization:
Each section highlights a different destination, providing a short description and a set of attractive images that capture the beauty of the location.

Styling and Design:
A custom CSS file defines the website’s appearance, including layout, colors, fonts, and background visuals, ensuring a clean and modern look.

Bootstrap Integration:
Bootstrap is used for UI components like buttons (btn, btn-primary) and carousels (carousel). While the grid system isn’t used extensively, Flexbox helps achieve a structured, balanced layout.

JavaScript Functionality:
A simple JavaScript function controls which section is displayed, making the navigation interactive. The display() function toggles visibility when buttons are clicked.

Image Display:
Destination images are displayed using <img> tags that link to external image URLs. These enhance the visual storytelling of each section.

Carousel Feature:
The Bootstrap carousel is used to show multiple images per destination, allowing users to explore each place through a smooth image slideshow.
